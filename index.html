    <h1>Baking a Cake</h1>
    <h3>Here you will learn how to bake a cake.</h3>

    <hr />

    <p>Baking was a hobby of mine that I just rediscovered about a year ago.</p>
    <p>I used to bake more often but life got too crazy and I got away from it. Now I make an effort to do it every once in a while because it brings me so much joy!</p>

        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, eggs, buttermilk, white vinegar and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Add granulated sugar, and whisk for 30 seconds to help the dissolve the sugar.</li>

        <li>Carefully flip the layers out of the pans, and place on a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>

    <p>Now all that is left to do it to build your cake and decorate it! You can fill it with whatever your heart desires, but you can never go wrong with a good cream cheese frosting.
